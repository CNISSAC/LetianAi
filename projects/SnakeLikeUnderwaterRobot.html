        <h2>Desing of Snake-like Underwater Robot</h2>
        <p> The ocean harbors abundant resources, including biological, mineral, energy, and spatial assets, making its exploration and development vital for the advancement of human society. 
            In this context, developing efficient, agile, and adaptable underwater vehicles for subaquatic tasks has emerged as a key area of research. 
            This work proposes a novel solution to overcome the limitations of traditional underwater robots, particularly their lack of flexibility, maneuverability, and autonomy, which hinders their effectiveness in complex marine environments. 
            By integrating concepts from underwater vehicle technology and continuum mechanics, this study introduces a design for an innovative snake-like underwater robot.</p>
