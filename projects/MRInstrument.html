        <h2>Robotic-Assisted Medical Instrument Planning and Execution using Mixed Reality</h2>
        <p> Robotic-assisted medical systems (RAMS) have
            gained significant attention for their advantages in alleviating
            clinician fatigue and improving patient outcomes. These systems
            encompass a range of human-robot interactions, including
            medical scene monitoring, anatomy target planning, and robot
            manipulation. However, despite their versatility and effective-
            ness, RAMS demand a high level of expertise from operators,
            creating a significant barrier between medical staff and the
            robotic system. In this work, we introduce a novel frame-
            work that provides informative and user-friendly interactions
            using mixed reality technologies to improve the interface and
            ease the use of RAMS. The proposed framework achieves
            on-the-fly instrument planning and execution by providing
            anatomic image overlay, avatar-based collision detection, and
            robot programming interface. </p>
