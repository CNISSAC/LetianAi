        <h2>Assessment of MRI Registration with Augmented Reality</h2>
        <p>There is a high demand to develop a user-friendly and reliable assessment method that can facilitate efficient
            and accurate selection of MRI registration methods. By observing that MRI data is stored in a 3D volumetric format,
            we drew inspiration from the growing applications of Augmented
            Reality (AR), which has a strong capability of enabling user interaction
            with 3D data. Thus, we designed an AR-based
            system to enhance the reliability and reduce the workload of MRI
            registration method assessment. </p>
