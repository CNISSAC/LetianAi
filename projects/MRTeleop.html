        <h2>Mixed Reality Based Teleoperation and Visualization of Surgical Robotics</h2>
        <p>Surgical robotics has revolutionized the field of surgery, facilitating complex procedures in operating rooms. 
            However, the current teleoperation systems often rely on bulky consoles, which limit the mobility of surgeons. 
            This restriction reduces surgeons' awareness of the patient during procedures and narrows the range of implementation scenarios. 
            To address these challenges, we propose an alternative solution: a Mixed Reality-based teleoperation system. 
            This system leverages hand gestures, head motion tracking, and speech commands to enable the teleoperation of surgical robots. 
            Our implementation focuses on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and utilizes the capabilities of Microsoft HoloLens 2. </p>
